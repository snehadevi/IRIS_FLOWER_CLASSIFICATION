# IRIS_FLOWER_CLASSIFICATION
## ML LAB PROJECT
Since the iris dataset is too small it works almost perfectly even with simplest model architecture like 1-layer NN or Multilayer Perceptron model. So, the dataset is plotted using both sepal and petal features separately. The plots clearly shows that with both features the dataset is visually separable. Although it looks like using sepal features for training will be tougher. So, various classification model is trained on the dataset with only the sepal features to compare various model's compatibility.
